            6. Do you have a permanent workstation or do you work in a variety of areas?
            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            In order to enhance, explore and learn more from our co-op experience, I have chosen to work on a rotational schedule, where we work with different students in different types of camps. For example:
            <ol>
            <li> Week 1: RC Engineering/Robotics Jr. (helped at both simultaneously)</li>
            <li> Week 2: Computer Animation/Video Game Design (helped at both simultaneously)</li>
            <li> Week 3: Minecraft/Robotics Jr. (switched mid-week)</li>
            <li> Week 4: Computer Animation/Video Game Design (helped at both simultaneously)</li>
            <li> Week 5: Minecraft/Robotics Jr. (switched mid-week)</li>
            <li> Week 6: Robotics Sr.</li>
            </ol>
            
            By working in a schedule, such as this, I am able to use my skills to help young children and apply my knowledge into a variety of areas.

            7. What is career or job you are learning about and will you be learning about any other job?
            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            Currently, I am indirectly learning about many jobs and directly learning about jobs by working with people who have these career choices. One example of a profession I am directly learning is camp counsellor, as I am able to observe how they run and organize camps. I also learn how they handle stressful or overwhelming and unwanted situations. I am also learning about jobs in the technology and engineering fields, however indirectly. I use my skills that are related to technology and help other students, which is giving me an insight on the vast fields present within technology. Some examples are video game design, animation, robotics, etc.

            8. Do you have a list of tasks that you are expected to work on every day? What are they?
            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            My tasks usually fluctuate depending on the requirement of the camp and the students, however there are a lot of similarities between all of the camps. <ol>
            <li> Come at 8:00am and play with the kids in the gym till 9:00am</li>
            <li> Go to the assigned rooms with the students</li>
            <li> Do some introductory activities (Day 1 only)</li>
            <li> Start/continue activities according to Senior Counsellor instructions</li>
            <li>Around 12:00pm have lunch with students and put on movie (optional)</li>
            <li> Go outside for 30 minutes break </li>
            <li> Return to activities and then lead students to gym around 3:50pm for pick-up</li>
            </ol>

            9. What safety instruction did you have before you began working at your placement and do you have to wear any personal protective equipment at your workplace? (Include in your answer a list of possible hazards (i.e. biological, chemical, ergonomic or physical) and what you would do in case of personal injury).
            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            In order to work at any workplace, you are required to complete some training and understand the hazards of working at a certain location. We were required to do some training (how to handle situations, handling injury, etc). No personal protection equipment was required to be worn, as there weren't any hazards that would require such precautions. There are only some minor hazards at our workplace, which include:
            <ol>
                <li>Ergonomic Injuries: sitting in a position for too long.</li>
                <li>Physical Injuries: tripping, falling, hit by an object, etc.</li>
            </ol>
            If I was to suffer a personal injury, I would first analyze the seriousness of the injury and if serious attention is required. Next, I would let my supervisor and Senior Counsellor know about the injury. I would also find a solution to treat it right away, if it is serious and use the medical equipment in the first aid kit.  
            </div>
        
        <div class="wrapperQuestion">
            10. Where is the first aid kit located? Is there any employee certified to administer first aid?
            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            Each room has their own first aid kit, depending on each camp. Some camps have a main desk for counsellors, which is where the first kit is kept. Usually, the first aid kit is brought outside when we go out for free recess. Some employees are first aid trained and the main supervisor, Nicole, is also first aid certified. I am also able to administer first aid, as I have also done the course and am eligible to perform it, if needed.
