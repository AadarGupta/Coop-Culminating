            The original company is called Emote Media Inc. which is continuing business as Brick Works Academy. Mr. David Goodfellow founded the company in 2012 and it is a family owned business. The current owners are Mr. D. Goodfellow, and Mrs. Goodfellow. This summer (year of 2018), Brick Works Academy hosted 4100 students with around 90 employees (all locations combined). Their program throughout the year has a small staff of Mr. Goodfellow, Mrs. Goodfellow, and their daughter.

            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            Brickworks Academy provides many services, which run in many different cities across Ontario and their programs differ depending on customer needs and time of the year. They run camps in: <div id="indent"><dl><dd>- Hamilton</dd><dd>- Burlington</dd>

            <dd>- Cambridge</dd>

            They mainly focus on S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math). Students at the Brickworks Academy Summer Camp focus on LEGO Robotics (Jr. and Sr.), Minecraft, Animation/Photography, Mario, Pokemon and Game Design. They have regular Saturday workshops, where they focus on LEGO Robotics and Minecraft. The summer camps run by Brickworks run from 8:00am to 4:00pm. The camp in 2018, starts on July 3rd and ends on August 24th. The children change every week depending on their booking and obtain a certificate, a magnet, and other prizes at the end of the camp.

            3. How any employees are employed at the company?
            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            Brickworks Academy has expanded their camps to many cities and hence require staff to run and maintain the camps. The summer camps usually consist of 8-13 camps and 4-6 rooms to run them. The Hamilton camp has 14 employees, 11 of which are paid counsellors and 3 co-op students (Aadar, Abhay and Muhammad).

            4. Who is your supervisor and if he/she is not available, who is responsible for your training and signing your logs?
            </div>
        <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            The Hamilton location of the Brickworks Academy Summer Camp has 1 supervisor for all sections of the camp, and multiple counsellors who run the camp. The primary supervisor for co-op students, including me, is the camp leader, which depends on which camp we are working with in that week. Our main supervisor is Nicole, who is responsible for training and signing our logs. If she is unavailable, we send her the logs through hour republic and she confirms and signs them, when she gets the time.

        <div class="wrapperQuestion">
            5. Do you work closely with your supervisor or does your supervisor expect you to work independently?
            </div>
            <div class="wrapperAnswer">
            Since our main supervior manages the overall camps, we are not required to work with her all of the time. We work alongside the other counsellors, which are respective to their own camp and interact with Nicole, when we need to. For example, if we will not be attending/missing some days, then we speak with her and all scheduling needs are dealt by her.
